# ⚡ Day 4: CMOS Noise Margin and Robustness Evaluation

## 🎯 Objective
The goal for **Day 4** was to understand and analyze the **Noise Margin** of a CMOS inverter and evaluate its **robustness** in the presence of electrical noise.  
This builds upon the previous day's exploration of **CMOS inverter characteristics** and **voltage transfer behavior**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Definition of Noise Margin
**Noise Margin (NM)** represents the tolerance of a logic circuit against unwanted disturbances or noise.  
It defines the **maximum noise voltage** that can be added to a signal without changing its logical interpretation.

🧠 In simple terms —  
Noise Margin determines **how immune** your circuit is to unwanted voltage fluctuations.

### 2️⃣ I/O Characteristics of CMOS Inverter

#### 🔹 Ideal Inverter
- Exhibits a **perfect rectangular transfer** characteristic  
- Has an **infinite slope** in the transition region  
- Switching between logic `0` and `1` happens **instantly**

#### 🔹 Actual (Practical) Inverter
- The transition between logic levels is **gradual**  
- The slope is **finite**, not infinite  
- The voltage transfer curve is **curved** instead of sharp

🖼️ *Example: Practical CMOS I/O Curve — slope ≈ −1 in transition region*

### 3️⃣ Key Voltage Parameters

| Symbol | Description | Function |
|:-------:|--------------|-----------|
| **V_IL** | Input Low Voltage | Maximum input voltage recognized as logic ‘0’ |
| **V_IH** | Input High Voltage | Minimum input voltage recognized as logic ‘1’ |
| **V_OL** | Output Low Voltage | Output voltage corresponding to logic ‘0’ |
| **V_OH** | Output High Voltage | Output voltage corresponding to logic ‘1’ |

These points define the **noise tolerance window** of a CMOS inverter.

---

### 4️⃣ Logic Level Relationships

From the inverter’s I/O curve:

- If **0 < Vin < V_IL → Vout = HIGH**
- If **V_IH < Vin < V_DD → Vout = LOW**

To ensure proper logic recognition by the next stage:
- V_OL < V_IL → logic 0 correctly detected
- V_OH > V_IH → logic 1 correctly detected

---

### 5️⃣ Noise Margins

Noise margins define how much **noise** can be tolerated **without logic error**.

#### 🟢 Noise Margin High (NM_H)
- NM_H = V_OH - V_IH
 → Maximum noise voltage a logic **HIGH** can withstand and still be recognized as HIGH.

#### 🔵 Noise Margin Low (NM_L)
-  NM_L = V_IL - V_OL
  → Maximum noise voltage a logic **LOW** can tolerate and still be recognized as LOW.

### 6️⃣ Undefined Region
Between **V_IL** and **V_IH**, the logic level is **undefined**.  
Voltages in this region may be **unpredictably interpreted** as logic 0 or logic 1 depending on transistor mismatch, supply variations, or temperature.

---

### 7️⃣ Effect of (W/L) Ratio on Noise Margin

As the **PMOS width (W/L)p** increases:
- PMOS drive strength ↑  
- NMOS relative strength ↓  
- **NM_L** (Noise Margin Low) decreases  
- **NM_H** (Noise Margin High) increases  

✅ Balanced design ensures both noise margins are sufficient for stable logic operation.

## 🧪 Day 4 Lab — Noise Margin / Robustness Analysis

### 🧩 SPICE Deck Overview
A simple SPICE simulation was performed to extract **VTC characteristics** and compute **noise margins**.

🧱 The simulation identifies the **points where slope = −1** in the VTC curve —  
these are the boundaries of **V_IL** and **V_IH**.

---

### 📊 Extracted Simulation Data

| Parameter | Value (V) | Description |
|:-----------|:-----------:|-------------|
| **V_IL** | 0.7780 | Input Low Voltage |
| **V_IH** | 0.9923 | Input High Voltage |
| **V_OL** | 0.0877 | Output Low Voltage |
| **V_OH** | 1.6959 | Output High Voltage |

---

### 🧮 Noise Margin Calculations

#### 🔵 Noise Margin High (NM_H)
- NM_H = V_OH - V_IH
- NM_H = 1.6959 - 0.9923 = 0.7036 V

#### 🟢 Noise Margin Low (NM_L)
- NM_L = V_IL - V_OL
- NM_L = 0.7780 - 0.0877 = 0.6903 V
  
✅ **Result Summary:**
| Parameter | Value (V) | Interpretation |
|:-----------|:-----------:|----------------|
| **NM_H** | 0.7036 | Robust logic ‘1’ tolerance |
| **NM_L** | 0.6903 | Robust logic ‘0’ tolerance |

---

### 🧠 Interpretation

- If **output lies within NM_H**, logic ‘1’ is correctly recognized.  
- If **output lies within NM_L**, logic ‘0’ is correctly recognized.  
- The near-symmetry of NM_H and NM_L indicates a **balanced inverter design**.

---

## ⚛️ Device Physics Correlation

- **Noise Margin** depends on **transistor sizing (W/L)** and **drive strength**.  
- Proper sizing (PMOS ≈ 2× NMOS) ensures **balanced noise margins**.  
- Short-circuit currents near **Vm (switching threshold)** slightly influence NM_H / NM_L.  
- A robust inverter ensures **next-stage recognition** without logic errors even in presence of small noise.
